# .npmrc - npm/pnpm configuration for Genesis App
# ================================================
#
# This file configures the package manager behavior for the monorepo.
# These settings apply to all packages within the workspace.
#
# Configuration Options:
# ----------------------

# Automatically install peer dependencies
# When a package declares a peer dependency, pnpm will automatically
# install it alongside the package, reducing manual dependency management.
auto-install-peers=true

# Disable strict peer dependency checking
# This prevents build failures when peer dependency versions don't
# exactly match. Useful in monorepos where version alignment can be
# managed at the workspace level.
strict-peer-dependencies=false

# Use hoisted node_modules layout
# This creates a flatter node_modules structure that is more compatible
# with tools that expect traditional npm layouts.
shamefully-hoist=true

# Prefer workspace packages over registry versions
# When a dependency matches a workspace package, use the local version
# instead of fetching from the registry.
prefer-workspace-packages=true

# Link workspace packages
# Ensures workspace packages are symlinked rather than copied,
# enabling real-time development across packages.
link-workspace-packages=true
