# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# ===================
#
# This file defines the workspace configuration for the Neolith monorepo.
# It specifies which directories contain packages that should be linked together
# and managed as a single workspace.
#
# Workspace Structure:
# --------------------
# packages/@wundr/neolith/
#   apps/           - Application packages (web, api, cli)
#   packages/       - Shared library packages (ui, utils, config)
#
# Usage:
# ------
# - All packages in apps/* and packages/* will be linked together
# - Dependencies between workspace packages are automatically resolved
# - Use workspace protocol (workspace:*) for internal dependencies
#
# Example package.json dependency:
#   "dependencies": {
#     "@neolith/ui": "workspace:*"
#   }
#
# For more information, see:
# https://pnpm.io/workspaces

packages:
  # Application packages
  # Contains deployable applications like web frontend, API server, CLI tools
  - "apps/*"

  # Shared library packages (scoped under @neolith)
  # Contains reusable libraries, UI components, utilities, and configurations
  - "packages/@neolith/*"
