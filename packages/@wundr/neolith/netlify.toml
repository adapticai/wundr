# Neolith Netlify Deployment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This configuration deploys the Neolith web application to Netlify.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Netlify CLI installed: npm install -g netlify-cli
#   - Login to Netlify: netlify login
#   - Link site: netlify link
#
# Deployment:
#   netlify deploy --prod

  # 3. Generate Prisma client
  # 4. Build @neolith/web from root
