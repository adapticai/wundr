# Neolith Netlify Deployment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This configuration deploys the Neolith web application to Netlify.
# Located at repo root to ensure pnpm-lock.yaml is detected.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Netlify CLI installed: npm install -g netlify-cli
#   - Login to Netlify: netlify login
#   - Link site: netlify link
#
# Deployment:
#   netlify deploy --prod
#
# =============================================================================

  # Runs from the repository ROOT where pnpm-lock.yaml exists.
  # This is required for Netlify to detect pnpm and install dependencies correctly.

  # 1. Install dependencies with hoisting (for Netlify Lambda compatibility)
  # 2. Generate Prisma client
  # 3. Build the neolith web app
