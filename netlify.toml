# Neolith Netlify Deployment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This configuration deploys the Neolith web application to Netlify.
# Located at repo root so Netlify can detect pnpm-lock.yaml for dependencies.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Netlify CLI installed: npm install -g netlify-cli
#   - Login to Netlify: netlify login
#   - Link site: netlify link
#
# Deployment:
#   netlify deploy --prod
